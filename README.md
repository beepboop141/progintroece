# progintroece
i hate format <3333
absolutely horrible exercise 

but basically the solutions to the labs for progintro ece ntua ? 

is the code the best? absolutely not there are a lot of things that are just bad practice and unecessary BUT!! i was learning and it works : ) 

also i was lazy as you can see by the lack of comments and just lazy things in the code 

it is not a great example of what you should do 


PLEASE READ: 

ideally do not copy the solutions- i don't endorse it because you are supposed to learn by yourself 

and academic honesty/integrity/plagiarism etc. 

it is supposed to be a helpful tool

if you are here however (in true ntua fashion)... 

i can't take any responsibility it's your degree but like you shouldn't do it?
